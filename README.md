# Menu Tests

This project is part of the Chuck Norris Jokes project I'm working on.

The purpose of this project is to explore the way a menu is added to an Android appllication using
the AppBar.

## How final app will look like

I want to finally have an application that has a menu item in the AppBar which when clicked opens
a popup menu having several options. Clicking on an option in the popup menu will show a toast
presenting which option was choosed.

## Documentation

The whole process will be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/citrone/menu-tests/wiki/)
